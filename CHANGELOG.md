# Changelog

All notable changes to agric-satellite-analysis will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Field land report tab now shows a six-dimension hexagon of crop, soil, season vigor, weather, flood safety, and drought safety from that field's latest successful report. Generate the report first if no scores are shown; older reports without stored scores need a new generate.
- Sentinel-1 agri ingest now defaults to Microsoft Planetary Computer (`sentinel-1-grd`, SAS-signed Azure assets) instead of Element84 requester-pays S3. Optical S2 still uses `STAC_API_URL`.
- Optional cloud-removal step for cloudy crop-field satellite scenes. It is off by default. When turned on, a second product is stored next to the raw scene. Only high-quality results are used for drought and similar official metrics; lower-quality results are kept for audit. Raw cloudy scenes are not overwritten.
- Mean NDVI chart tooltips now show cloud cover and a short de-cloud quality note (clear raw, good, or possibly unreliable fair/poor) for the product actually plotted that day. Fair or poor cloud-removed values can appear as a separate marked series.
- Fair and poor cloud-removed scenes are saved next to the raw scene whenever the reconstruction produced usable pixels, so those dates no longer disappear from the field history. Drought and other official land metrics still ignore them.

### Changed
- Optional cloud-removal now waits until nearby field windows (optical and radar) for that job are downloaded, then cleans cloudy dates in one batch. It no longer tries to clean a single cloudy date the moment that date finishes, which often lacked nearby scenes and produced empty or poor results. Raw scenes are still saved as they complete. Only high-quality cloud-removed products are used for official drought numbers. Fair and poor cloud-removed products are still saved and labelled as possibly unreliable.
- Cloud-removal can now run on satellite scenes with up to 90% scene cloud (was 80). It still starts when the field or the scene is above 30% cloud.
- On dates with both a raw scene and a high-quality cloud-removed product, drought still prefers a closer match to nearby clear days when the field is borderline cloudy. NDVI and similar growth charts go further: they prefer the raw scene when it better matches nearby clear days and the crop season, even if the cloud-removed product scored good.
- Agri drought maps now follow NDDI first (Gu et al. 2007). Healthy green canopy is much less likely to show as mild or severe drought. Dates with cloud cover above 30% are left out of drought.
- Field drought days now use the growing season (June-September by default) and a two-part rule: dry NDDI (or a dry same-month percentile) plus either dry NDMI or a drop in NDVI versus that month's median. Cloudy or poor de-cloud dates are skipped.
- Field flood days now use Sentinel-1 VV against a per-orbit baseline (low VV, a drop versus that orbit's median, and a VH helper). Near-threshold dates are marked watch. Spring detections may be irrigation puddles, not disaster flood.
- The agri time-series panel marks historical drought days on the chart and date list.
- Agri field satellite refresh now writes color-spot data directly after computing indices. It no longer stores large index image files in object storage. Existing stored images are left as-is; new runs do not add more.
- Historical vegetation-index and Sentinel-1 jobs now process multiple satellite scenes at the same time (up to 16 per job by default), so a field backfill finishes faster without adding more Celery workers.
- A single satellite scene now downloads its image bands together instead of one after another, so multi-band crop-field refreshes finish sooner.

### Fixed
- Optical Sentinel-2 scenes are still saved when the optional cloud-removal scratch cache cannot write a temporary array file.
- NDVI date tooltips no longer show 0% cloud on heavily cloudy Sentinel-2 scenes. Empty or unknown field cloud is left blank (or uses the satellite scene cloud) instead of being stored or drawn as 0.
- NDVI date tooltips no longer show a stuck ~82% field cloud on small fields. That number was empty space around the field, not cloud. Tooltips now use in-field cloud, or the satellite scene cloud when an old stored value looks wrong.
- Cloud-removal now writes field-window files to a temporary name that the array library can rename, so nearby scenes are not silently dropped.
- Cloud-removal no longer skips saving a reconstructed scene just because in-field sampling found no strong NDVI pixels. Fair and poor results are stored with quality notes instead of disappearing.
- Cloud-removal now loads the official UnCRtainTS weights correctly. Earlier loads missed the network prefix and the usual checkpoint filename, so reconstructions were wrong.
- Sentinel-1 agri scenes download via Planetary Computer SAS-signed Azure assets (no AWS requester-pays keys). Earlier unsigned Element84/S3 reads returned 403 and jobs often finished with zero scenes saved.
- Background workers reconnect after a brief Redis interruption instead of sitting idle until the worker is restarted.
- Linking satellite index products to a field after backfill no longer fails on an internal formatting error.
